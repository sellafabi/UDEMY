    Woo Seo Ri, a violin prodigy at seventeen who was about to study in Germany, <br/>
    got into a bus accident and fell into a coma, waking up thirteen years later. <br/>
    Mentally, she is still only seventeen, while physically, she is now thirty. <br/>
    Due to a trauma he experienced thirteen years earlier, Gong Woo Jin does not <br/>
    want to have a relationship with others. This series is about a man and a woman <br/>
    whose lives, in their own ways, essentially paused at seventeen. Together, they <br/>
    use all their might to try and open the door to the happiness they once thought <br/>
    had been closed to them.
