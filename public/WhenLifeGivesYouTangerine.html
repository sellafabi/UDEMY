<h4>
    It is a story that resembles a tribute to our parents' tender and still youthful seasons <br/>
    when they were so young, including the story of mother's first love, father's heroic <br/>
    tales, grandma's rebellious youth, and grandpa's romantic era. Ae Sun is rebellious but <br/>
    gets nervous every time she rebels. She is not well off but is always shining and full <br/>
    of positivity. She dreams of becoming a poet, although she cannot attend school, and she <br/>
    is a bold character who doesn’t hide any emotions. Gwan Sik is an extremely diligent and <br/>
    quiet character. Romance is not a strength for him, and he doesn’t know how to act if Ae <br/>
    Sun cries or laughs, but he is a silent warrior who only loves Ae Sun from the very <br/>
    beginning and pours his all into loving her.
