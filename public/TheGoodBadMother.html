<h4>
    Young Soon is a single mother and pig farmer who raised her son Kang Ho alone. <br/>
    Despite her love for him, her strict parenting caused Kang Ho to view her as a bad <br/>
    mother. As an adult, Kang Ho became a cold-hearted prosecutor and kept his distance <br/>
    from his mother. However, an unexpected accident caused him to return to his hometown <br/>
    and start over with Young Soon. Kang Ho's childhood friend Mi Joo, known for her warm <br/>
    heart and strong sense of justice, also reconnected with him after his accident, leading <br/>
    to a transformative experience for her.
